        "text_1_2": lazy_gettext("Originally developed for cultivating edible mushrooms, AoT has grown to do much more. The system consists of two parts, a backend (daemon) and a frontend (web server). The backend performs tasks such as acquiring measurements from sensors and devices and coordinating a diverse set of responses to those measurements, including the ability to modulate outputs (switch relays, generate PWM signals, operate pumps, switch wireless outlets, publish/subscribe to MQTT, among others), regulate environmental conditions with PID control, schedule timers, capture photos and stream video, trigger actions when measurements meet certain conditions, and more. The frontend hosts a web interface that enables viewing and configuration from any browser-enabled device."),
        "text_1_3": lazy_gettext("There are a number of different uses for AoT. Some users simply store sensor measurements to monitor conditions remotely, others regulate the environmental conditions of a physical space, while others capture motion-activated or time-lapse photography, among other uses."),
        "text_1_4": lazy_gettext("Input controllers acquire measurements and store them in the InfluxDB time series database. Measurements typically come from sensors, but may also be configured to use the return value of Linux Bash or Python commands, or math equations, making this a very dynamic system for acquiring and generating data."),
        "text_1_5": lazy_gettext("Output controllers produce changes to the general input/output (GPIO) pins or may be configured to execute Linux Bash or Python commands, enabling a variety of potential uses. There are a few different types of outputs: simple switching of GPIO pins (HIGH/LOW), generating pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals, controlling peristaltic pumps, MQTT publishing, and more."),
        "text_1_6": lazy_gettext("When Inputs and Outputs are combined, Function controllers may be used to create feedback loops that uses the Output device to modulate an environmental condition the Input measures. Certain Inputs may be coupled with certain Outputs to create a variety of different control and regulation applications. Beyond simple regulation, Methods may be used to create a changing setpoint over time, enabling such things as thermal cyclers, reflow ovens, environmental simulation for terrariums, food and beverage fermentation or curing, and cooking food ([sous-vide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide)), to name a few."),

Select a time frame and data will be loaded from that time span, if it exists. The first view will be of the entire selected data set. For every view/zoom, 700 data points will be loaded. If there are more than 700 data points recorded for the time span selected, 700 points will be created from an averaging of the points in that time span. This enables much less data to be used to navigate a large data set. For instance, 4 months of data may be 10 megabytes if all of it were downloaded. However, when viewing a 4 month span, it's not possible to see every data point of that 10 megabytes, and aggregating of points is inevitable. With asynchronous loading of data, you only download what you see. So, instead of downloading 10 megabytes every graph load, only ~50kb will be downloaded until a new zoom level is selected, at which time only another ~50kb is downloaded."),
